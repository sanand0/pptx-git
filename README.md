# PowerPoint version control

The [Office Open XML](http://officeopenxml.com/) standards are a bit difficult
to understand.

I'm going to take a presentation, perform simple operations on it (like add a
line, etc.) and see what changes in the XML. That makes it easier to figure
out how exactly the XML works.

The other advantage is that this gives a nice way of versioning Office
documents. Just unzip it (I use `7z x file.pptx`) and put it into a git repo.
